/**
 * Utility script for spawning a proxy server and a mock server that are
 * based on a given OpenAPI document. The path to the OpenAPI file can be
 * provided as the first CLI argument.
 *
 * Use the npm script 'dev-mock' for conveniently running this script,
 * e.g.:
 *      npm run dev-mock -- path_to_schema/file.yaml
 *
 * Run without arguments to use the hard-coded path:
 *      npm run dev-mock
